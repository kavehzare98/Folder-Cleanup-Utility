# Folder Cleanup Utility

## A. Problem statement

1. **Disorganization:** Over time, files in a folder can become disorganized, making it difficult for users to locate specific files quickly. This software helps maintain a tidy folder structure by categorizing files according to their types.

2. **Time-consuming manual organization:** Manually sorting files into different folders based on their types can be a time-consuming task, especially when dealing with a large number of files. The software automates this process, saving users time and effort.

## B. Solution

This program organizes files in specified folders based on their file extensions. It includes two main modules: `downloads_functions` for cleaning up the Downloads folder and `documents_functions` for cleaning up the Documents folder. The cleanup is categorized into different folders based on file types.

## C. Benefits

1. **Efficiency:** With organized folders, users can locate and access files more efficiently. This is particularly useful for individuals who work with a variety of file types and need a streamlined system for managing their data.

2. **Consistency:** The software ensures consistency in file organization, preventing the accumulation of unsorted files and maintaining a clean and structured file system.

3. **Reduced clutter:** A cluttered desktop or folder structure can lead to a less productive and more chaotic digital workspace. The software helps reduce clutter by systematically arranging files in their appropriate locations.

4. **File type recognition:** The software identifies file types based on their extensions and directs them to designated folders, promoting a systematic approach to file management.

In summary, the software streamlines the process of organizing files, saving users time, improving efficiency, and contributing to a more organized and productive digital workspace.

## D. Features

## E. Getting Started

### Usage

1. Run `main.py`.
2. Enter `1` to cleanup the Downloads folder or `2` to cleanup the Documents folder.
3. The script will create directories and move files based on their types.

### Modules

- Defines file extensions for different categories in the Downloads folder.
- Provides functions to create directories, map files based on extensions, and move files to respective folders.

#### `documents_functions.py`

- Defines file extensions for different document categories.
- Provides functions to create directories, map files based on extensions, and move files to respective folders.

#### `main.py`

- The main script that prompts the user to choose between cleaning up the Downloads or Documents folder.
- Executes the cleanup process using functions from `downloads_functions` or `documents_functions`.

### Notes

- Hidden files (those starting with a dot) are ignored during file mapping (e.g. ".localized").
