Considerations for future improvement:

1. Error Handling
    - Use try-except blocks to catch exceptions and provide robust error messages.

2. Configurability
    - Make the script more versatile by allowing user to specify input and output directories and size thresholds.

3. Logging
    - Introduce logging to record information about the execution process which can be great for debugging.

4. Unit Testing
    - Ensures that individual functions behave as expected. This facilitates code maintenance and refactoring.

5. Efficiency
    - Consider processing files in batches or using parallel processing for improved performance.

6. Documentation
    - Provide comprehensive documentation for the script, information on how to use it, what it does, and any
      assumptions or limitations.

7. Usability
    - Enhance user experience by adding informative messages and prompts, notifying users when directories are created
      or when files are moved.
